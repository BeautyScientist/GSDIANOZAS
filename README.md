## **Getting Stuff Done In A World of Zero Attention Span**

#### **Introduction**

Like many people, maybe most people, I am struggling with a poor attention span.   There are so many distractions. And they are all bright and shiny and  are literally designed to grab our eyeballs.

I was having a particularly bad day with this and decided it was time to try and run with the stream rather than against it. Can I use the atomised nature of time in a world run by tech to achieve the sort of long-term goals that I have always imagined can only be done with long bouts of concentration? 

So here’s the plan. Let’s try splitting the day up into 6-minute sessions \- 5 for working and 1 for admin \- and see if, even with this constraint, something worthwhile can be created. For example \- a book on how to cope with continual interruptions. This opening paragraph is my first trial with the concept.

#### **Can I Use The Social Pressure Of Social Media To My Advantage?**

One of the reasons social media is so powerful, on me at any rate, is that at some level I actually care what all these people I don’t know from Adam think about me. It is a completely crazy thing of course, especially given that a reasonably large number of them are either insentient bots or professional trolls paid to influence me on behalf of entities I would probably not approve of. But somehow I behave as if they matter.

So can I use this to encourage me. If I make committments to people online who may not exist and certainly don’t care whether or not I do, will that encourage me to keep to those commitments?

I’ll try by announcing on Bluesky and Twitter that I am writing a book an how to cope with distractions. In all likelihood nobody will read that tweet nor expect me to follow up my on promise. But maybe it will work to keep me on the job regardless.

#### **The Strategy**

The goal of this 5-minute burst strategy is to use blocks of time that I would otherwise waste for productive activities, and to overcome a long, deeply ingrained problem. I am very prone to putting important activities on lists and then either forgetting about them or spending a lot of time managing and prioritising them. This results in a lot of things I am ‘working on’ that in fact never get worked on.  

So the strategy is to have a card for absolutely every activity/project/process and to continually cycle through them. I have to have some kind of priority list for the stuff that is critical, and I have already created that. The priority list needs to be kept to 10 or fewer jobs that have to be done. I am currently on 22 but I think it is better to work down to the right number by clearing them off the list rather than moving them again. 

		

#### **Progress Report 10/11/24**

I am into day three of using 5 minute bursts as my primary activity for getting things done, and so far it is working well. I have at least a dozen jobs on the go, and I am making progress on all of them. I am still spending more time on trivia than I would like but I am beginning to actually enjoy the 5 minute bursts in the same way that I do reading a tweet or watching a YouTube video. I don’t think the dopamine hit is as high, but it is there. There is clearly a skill to working this way that I am still to acquire, but it I am already noticing an improvement. It is surprisingly close to the feeling I get on the occassions I have managed to successfully get into the flow state. Successfully biting off a bit of a task feels good.

#### **Randomness Rules**

Using Apple Shortcuts has been something of a revelation for automating stuff to make it easier. Okay, it’s a nightmare platform to work with. But when it is working it is great for removing the barriers to getting started.  

Setting up a set of short bursts that automatically increment to other ones is proving to be a compelling way of keeping myself engaged with what I am doing and getting stuff done. 

I will work on this to improve it further, but it is already giving me a stronger feeling of being in control of my workload. The most powerful bit seems to be using the random feature. I think it is a bit like how I much prefer random music playlists so I get an element of surprise that keeps me interested. It also means I can sneak in interesting jobs. 

But the biggest thing is that I just like keeping to the schedule and finishing off the routine the programme sets for me. It is a more powerful motivator than making money or even pleasing people. I am a strange person.

#### **Stop Seeking Distractions**

“It’s a job that’s never started,  that is hardest to finish.” 

That is a saying that is very true. But my particular take on it is that I have a whole range of activities that prevent me from getting going. The first one is checking the news. I have a permanent desire to know what the latest thing going on is \- even though almost everything that goes on needs almost no input from me. 

I also check my bank balance regularly. It doesn’t earn me any money. And I have drinks and snacks way more often than is biologically necessary. 

I put energy into seeking out these distractions.

I have huge swathes of time available if I can cut down on that.	

#### **It’s all down to you**

If you have a good character you take full responsibility for your actions and the consequences of those actions. You don’t blame luck, circumstances or other people. But this attitude isn’t just a ‘good thing’. It is also the most practical way of dealing with your life. You can rarely do much about the material circumstances you find yourself in. And it is pretty rare that you can change other people’s behaviour. Trying to do so may well make them worse. 

But you can control what you do, including how you react to things. And most of what we have to deal with is the result of our own actions, which we can change. For example, my current problem is that I have allowed myself to become overwhelmed with work. This is largely down to two characteristics I have. I love starting new things. And I love doing those things to a really high standard. The result is a huge number of half completed projects. If I am going to get out of my overwhelm \- I need to change what I do.

#### **Correct Length for a Work Session**

The famous Pomodoro technique proposes 25 minutes as the ideal length of a work session \- followed by a five-minute break. I have to say that this is pretty much the ideal length of time to work on something and make some reasonable progress. It is a good default value. But there are times when a much longer soak is needed. I’d say there’s another sweet spot at 3 hours for when you really want or need to focus intently. 

But there is also a drawback to the 25 minute block. For a start, it’s easy when you’ve done one session to feel you’ve finished. It can make the pain of getting started again more of a problem. And also, there is a limit to how many 25 minute sessions you can fit it. I find that much shorter sessions, down to as low as 5 minutes, can sometimes work much better if you have a lot of ground to cover. Today’s experiment is going to be starting off with short sessions and gradually increasing their length over the course of the day.

#### **We Are Amusing Ourselves To Death**

I watched a YouTube video called “Amusing Ourselves To Death” this morning. It was quite a slog at 15 minutes in length. But I persevered because the subject is important. Instant gratification websites like YouTube and the social media ones are continuing the process started with television of eroding our ability to focus. 

This is something that has been bothering me for a long time. It didn’t tell me anything I didn’t know. But constant repetition is a requirement for getting something ingrained.

As a result I have decided that whatever else I do, I am no longer going to take my phone into my bedroom at night. Reading is the easiest and most practical way of increasing focus. I want to at least get an hour or so of reading in every night before I get to sleep. I’ll keep track of how many books I complete as a metric to see if I am improving.

#### **Best Length for a Pomodoro Session**

I am a big fan of the pomodoro method and use it a lot. It was originally proposed as a method for studying, but I use it to cope with my perennial problem of having too many different projects on the go at a time. My strategy is typically to assign sequential pomodoro sessions to different projects so that I make at least some progress on all the main projects I am working on. The suggested length of pomodoro sessions is 25 minutes. I’ve done a lot of experimenting with this and I’d say that most of the time for most things, that is the optimum. But longer sessions can be good for big projects, and shorter ones are better when I don’t have the focus to get started. I’ve gone down to as short as 5 minutes and still made good progress \- or at least made some progress when it would have been easy to make no progress. Doing multiple short pomodoros also has the great advantage of avoiding tasks going ‘stale’ so that when you get back to them you’ve forgotten what you should be doing.

#### **Simple Procrastination Buster**

I have set up a system that I find helpful. Using Apple’ script language Shortcuts I have created a routine that selects a random URL from a list and opens it. I add trello cards, emails and documents I am working to to the list. I can then set it up to run these tasks for a period of time I define and for a specific number of the items on the list to be run.

I call it a procrastination buster, because the idea is that whenever I am reluctant to start anything big I can spend a bit of time nibbling away at my most important jobs.

Although the original motivation was to overcome my reluctance to get started, I am finding it is having some extra benefits that means I am using it more than I had originally intended. For a start I get a good feeling from having made even a tiny amount of progress on something I have been putting off. And secondly, it keeps things I am working on in mind so that when I do find the time and motivation to tackle them I have a good idea of what needs to be done.

8 Minute Random Bursts

It sounds crazy, but I have found setting up my computer to select tasks from a list and then spend 8 minutes on each task works extremely well. It doesn’t sound like it should. But it does.

Taking 

So today is Saturday and due to circumstances beyond my control I find myself with a pile of things that I really need to get done this weekend. So I went to my office with the intention of a solid three hours focus on getting things done.

Poor Performance

That’s not what happened. In fact I spent all day from 10:30 to 5:00pm and still got nowhere near my goal \- just 1hr 40 minutes of actual work. I was distracted by Bluesky, YouTube, the latest events in the US. I did do some thinking and get some stuff clear in my mind. But even so if I had focused I would have got it all done by lunchtime. Why do I do this?

Social Media is my biggest problem 

I’ve just posted this on Bluesky \-

“I’m going to stop using social media before lunchtime. Even when it’s wholesome I have better things to do with my attention.”

I am just too easily distracted by social media. I know I’m not the only one \- because of all the people I meet on social media. The thing that triggered this was reading about a thing called the 5am Club, which I came across by chance on social media. I didn’t read the details but I didn’t have to. Focusing on what you want to achieve not on what gives you a dopamine hit is what is important.

**Back after 3 month pause**

My experiment to see if I can slyly write a book in between all my other tasks in 10 minute blocks isn’t working out very well. I haven’t made any progress on it for months. It is the softest task on my list and consequently gets dropped nearly every day. (To be scrupulously fair, I have been suffering with several bouts of a nasty bug for the first few months of this year.)

It turns out that keeping to a strict schedule isn’t all that easy and doesn’t in fact create any new time for new projects. However I have been findining it easier to break big tasks down into smaller chunks as I have been practicing it more. And having lists of tasks that I pick from randomly helps in avoiding procrastination. These two things are helping me get more done in the sense of not leaving so many projects neglected to the point of me not knowing what I am doing with them. 

**Procrastination Busting when you have a lot of time**

I have just spent several hours getting about half an hour’s work done. I do this every so often. The situation is I have a fair bit of time spare and no particular deadline, but a lot I want to get done. Sundays and bank holidays are good examples. But I somehow never manage to get started, even though I have a really good level of motivation. Why is it so hard to get going? I don’t know. I think I might try a variation on the trick that often works of breaking things down to really small bits of jobs that only take a few minutes. This isn’t a great way to be productive but it is a good way of busting procrastination. So I’ll try doing some literally 2 minute sessions. This might work because 2 minutes is nothing and I’ll know I am not really comitting myself to anything in particular. Let’s see how it goes. 

**Cult of Done**

The Cult of Done is a document I think more people should know. Its history is not particularly interesting and if my online world is representitive it doesn’t come up very often.

It is based on the idea that things you make have 3 phases: ignorance, learning and completion. 

So you start not knowing what you are doing. Then you work at it and find out as best you can. Then you finish.

The bit it leaves out is tweaking and editing. You do something and reach a finishing point. You can call it a draft if you want, but it is effectively now a thing. If you don’t like it, don’t carry on working on it. Either use it as it is, or throw it away and do another.

I really like this approach. I find it difficult to use because I am a perfectionist. But I shouldn’t be. All those emails I spent 30 minutes polishing to read really well have brought me very little benefit. I should have set a timer and settled for what I had. And so on for most of my other activities.

**Switching to GitHub**

I've decided to switch this project from Google Docs to GitHub. The initial impetus for this was simply that using a GitHub repository (actual thing) as a repository (metaphor) was mentioned in the Cult of Done video that I listened to. It sounded like a cool thing to do. But more seriously there is a lot to be said for keeping key information at least backed up away from the big tech giants given that it turns out that the United States may not be as trustworthy as previous experience has led us to believe. It will be interesting to see how much functionality I lose by switching tools. 

**Cult of Done Principle 1 - The Three States of Being**

There are three states of being: Not knowing, action, and completion.
This principle recognizes that we all start from a place of uncertainty. Rather than staying stuck in that uncertainty, the path forward is to take action and move toward completion. Don't get trapped in endless research or planning - recognize these three distinct states and keep moving through them.

This is the first principle of the Cult of Done. On the whole, I don’t think that being overly taxanomic about activities is a good thing. Being actually active is a good thing. But this broad classification is helpful, largely because it labels that initial feeling when starting out on a project where there are lots of procrastination options available. It is always fun to do research. It is less arduous to compile a list of actions than to actually carry them out. But both researching and planning are necessary activities. When you are getting going on a project it is helpful to start by working out what you don’t know and deciding how you are going to go about finding out.

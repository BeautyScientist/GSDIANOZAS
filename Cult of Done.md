# The Cult of Done Manifesto: Expanded

Let me expand on each of the 13 principles to help you better understand and apply them:

### 1. There are three states of being: Not knowing, action, and completion.
This principle recognizes that we all start from a place of uncertainty. Rather than staying stuck in that uncertainty, the path forward is to take action and move toward completion. Don't get trapped in endless research or planning - recognize these three distinct states and keep moving through them.

### 2. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
Nothing is ever truly perfect or final. When you view your work as a draft, you remove the pressure of perfection. This mindset frees you to actually produce something rather than being paralyzed by the fear of imperfection. The goal is progress, not perfection.

### 3. There is no editing stage.
Rather than creating something and then spending endless time editing, integrate your improvements as you go. This principle challenges the idea that creation and refinement are separate processes. Instead, create, improve, and move on, treating each new iteration as a fresh creation rather than an edited version of the previous one.

### 4. Pretending you know what you're doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so accept that you know what you're doing even if you don't, and do it.
Confidence often precedes competence. By acting as if you know what you're doing, you push past the paralysis of self-doubt. This "fake it till you make it" approach acknowledges that action itself builds the knowledge and skills you need. Trust yourself and start moving.

### 5. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
Ideas have energy and momentum. If you don't capitalize on the initial enthusiasm, that energy dissipates. This principle enforces urgency - either act quickly on your ideas or let them go. This prevents an endless backlog of "someday" projects that drain your mental energy.

### 6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
Completion isn't an end in itself but a gateway to new beginnings. The true value of finishing something is the freedom it gives you to start something new. Recognize that each completion feeds into a cycle of creative production, not a static endpoint.

### 7. Once you're done, you can throw it away.
Detachment from outcomes is liberating. Not everything you create needs to be preserved or shared. The process often matters more than the product. This principle encourages you to value the experience and learning gained from creation, even if the final product isn't kept.

### 8. Laugh at perfection. It's boring and keeps you from being done.
Perfection is not only unattainable but often uninteresting. Flaws and quirks give work character and humanity. By rejecting perfectionism, you not only complete more work but often create more interesting, authentic results that connect with others.

### 9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.
Theory without practice has limited value. This principle values practical experience over pure theory - the wisdom gained from actual doing over hypothetical knowing. Getting your hands "dirty" with real work gives you insights that can't be gained any other way.

### 10. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
Failure and mistakes are valid forms of completion, not reasons to avoid starting. They provide crucial feedback and learning opportunities. By counting failures as "done," you reframe them as valuable outcomes rather than things to be avoided at all costs.

### 11. Destruction is a variant of done.
Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is to tear something down and start fresh. This principle acknowledges that demolition can be as creative and necessary as construction. Clearing away what doesn't work makes
